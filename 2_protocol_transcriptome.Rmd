# Transcriptome analysis

## Summary

The main steps to analysing transcriptome data are:

- Import counts
- - These counts are usually counts of transcripts and need to be converted to gene counts.
- Filtering
- - Filter lowly expressed genes to speed up analysis
- Exploratory data analysis
- - Use heatmaps and PCA plots to explore batch effect within the data and consider them throughout analysis.
- Batch effect correction (optional)
- - Apply ComBat-seq or equivalent to produce batch-corrected gene counts
